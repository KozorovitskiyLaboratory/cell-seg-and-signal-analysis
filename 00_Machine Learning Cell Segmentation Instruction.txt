Machine Learning Cell Segmentation Instruction

1. Remotely connect to K-Lab Dell Workstation

2. Go to the Terminal

3. Type the following:
conda activate cellpose

4. Now the conda environment for cell segmentation machine learning library is activated. 
Prepare the cell image (dapi channel (usually channel 1)) and the directory that it the image is stored.

5. Type the following: 
python -m cellpose --dir (directory where cell image is stored) --pretrained_model cyto --do_3D --chan 0 --use_gpu --learning_rate 0.1 --n_epochs 800 --batch_size 20 --cellprob_threshold 0 --save_tif 
(NOTE after --dir, type the directory where cell image is stored WITHOUT the parentheses)

6. After several minutes, the segmented cell image would be saved to the directory that you typed in the above command line. (Refer to the sample result in this file: 'Series5_C1_cp_masks_cellprobthresh0.tif')
